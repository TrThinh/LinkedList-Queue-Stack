# LinkedList-Queue-Stack
The program just demo as a system sent message use Queue ADT and Stack, and use LinkedList for that

Task: 
For the middleware that is currently developing, one part of the provision interface is how message can be transferred and processed through layers. For transport, normally a buffer of queue messages is implemented and for processing, the systems requires a stack of messages.
The team now has to develop these kind of collections for the system. They should design ADT / algorithms for these 2 structures and implement a demo version with message is a string of maximum 250 characters. The demo should demonstrate some important operations of these structures. Even itâ€™s a demo, errors should be handled carefully by exceptions and some tests should be executed to prove the correctness of algorithms / operations.
The team needs to write a report of the implementation of the 2 data structures and how to measure the efficiency of related algorithms. The report should also evaluate the use of ADT in design and development, including the complexity, the trade-off and the benefits
